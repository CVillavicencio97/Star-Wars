### MVP/PostMVP

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP 
*These are examples only. Replace with your own MVP features.*


- Find an API with ample data
- Create a button that extract's data from the API randomly
- Add a site background image related to Star Wars
- Use Star Wars esque font
- Use axios to make an API call
- Utilize flexbox 

#### PostMVP  
*These are examples only. Replace with your own Post-MVP features.*

- Add music
- Add gifs to the sites such as tie fighter across the screen

## Project Schedule

This schedule will be used to keep track of your progress throughout the week and align with our expectations.  

You are **responsible** for scheduling time with your squad to seek approval for each deliverable by the end of the corresponding day, excluding `Saturday` and `Sunday`.

|  Day | Deliverable | Status
|---|---| ---|
|April 16-18| Prompt / Wireframes / Priority Matrix / Timeframes | Incomplete
|April 19| Project Approval | Incomplete
|April 20| Core Application Structure (HTML, CSS, etc.) | Incomplete
|April 20| Pseudocode / actual code | Incomplete
|April 21| Initial Clickable Model  | Incomplete
|April 22| MVP | Incomplete

## Priority Matrix

## Timeframes

Tell us how long you anticipate spending on each area of development. Be sure to consider how many hours a day you plan to be coding and how many days you have available until presentation day.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Throughout your project, keep track of your Time Invested and Actual Time and update your README regularly.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Adding Form | H | 3hrs| 3.5hrs | 3.5hrs |
| Working with API | H | 3hrs| 2.5hrs | 2.5hrs |
| Total | H | 6hrs| 5hrs | 5hrs |
